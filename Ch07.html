<p>Effective grievance redressal mechanisms are essential for ensuring accountability and transparency in any organization. It is important for organizations to have a mechanism in place that allows individuals or groups to raise concerns and complaints about any issues they face. Grievance redressal mechanisms not only help in resolving conflicts but also improve the organization’s overall performance by identifying and addressing systemic issues.</p>
<section id="process-of-grievance-redressal-mechanism-at-bisp" class="level2" data-number="7.1">
<h2 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="process-of-grievance-redressal-mechanism-at-bisp"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Process of Grievance Redressal Mechanism at BISP</h2>
<p>Grievances can be raised by any affected party, including community members, civil society organizations, or other stakeholders. Grievances can be submitted in person, via email, by phone, through online portals, whatsapp groups and through BISP’s PCMS platform. BISP encourages affected parties to raise grievances as soon as possible after becoming aware of a problem or issue. There are numerous platforms available for beneficiaries to file a grievance with BISP, some glimpses of its operation and uptake process are noted in the following paragraphs.</p>
<section id="payment-complaint-management-system-pcms" class="level3" data-number="7.1.1">
<h3 data-number="7.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="payment-complaint-management-system-pcms"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Payment Complaint Management System (PCMS)</h3>
<p>BISP has developed an inhouse automated payment grievance redressal system called Payment Complaint Management System. PCMS is an automated interface that is used by the BISP’s Tehsil/District/Zonal offices to register the complaints of beneficiaries. PCMS is integrated with partner banks’ Complaint Resolution Mechanism (CRM) to facilitate complaints resolution in an efficient manner. With the PCMS and CRM integration, Turn around Time (TAT) for each complaint type has been embedded in the system which informs the TAT breach of each complaint for monitoring purpose. Overall, there are three main types of complaints which are further divided into 30 subtypes of complaints that the system can process.</p>
<p>PCMS is accessible at field level to Assistant Directors and officers ranked above him/her, however AD is primarily responsible for filing a complaint to PCMS, furthermore in most of the offices an assistant complaint is also deputed who is first point of contact for beneficiary facilitation. Beneficiary can easily walk-in to any tehsil office and lodge a complaint related to Biometric Verification System (BVS) which mainly includes verification failure or poor finger prints, Second type of major complaints filed by beneficiaries relate to Payment related issues which primarily include deductions and embezzlements while third major category of payment complaints covers quality of services concerning condition of facilities at POS, misconduct if any of POS agents, non-provision of receipts etc.</p>
<p>PCMS Platform is accessible through various avenues, the most common is walk-in beneficiaries who visit field offices, PCMS is also accessible on telephone and through one window operation services created by BISP at various locations across Pakistan. PCMS can lodge complaints against POS Agents, Bank Staff however it cannot do so if complaint has to be lodged against an AD who is the appointed custodian and operator of this system. In such case beneficiary will have to visit district or divisional office to file a complaint with his/her (AD) superior in written form.</p>

<section id="pakistan-citizens-portal" class="level3" data-number="7.1.2">
<h3 data-number="7.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pakistan-citizens-portal"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Pakistan Citizens Portal</h3>
<p>It is a Government owned platform used to promote citizen centric participatory governance. It provides nations wide window to connect people with government organizations at all levels for raising their issues with authorities, complaint redressal and suggestions. It helps to promote the culture of quantified performance management of and make various government entities accountable for their mandated roles and responsibilities. BISP has also been provided with a Pakistan Citizen portal interface which handles complaints related to BISP mainly filed by beneficiaries. In case a beneficiary cannot visit the field office or is not satisfied with the response at the field office can always access this platform to file a complaint. As soon as beneficiary files a complaint online it is forwarded to BISP handle where dedicated resources are available to review and respond to the complaints in a timely manner. A complaint is normally resolved within 20 days of filing otherwise it moves to escalated complaints and highlighted to Prime Ministers office. It is pertinent to mention that BISP has been performing exceptionally on this platform and was ranked number 3 in whole country for complaint resolution and beneficiary facilitation. From October 2022 to March 2023 BISP has received 10,733 complaints on Citizen’s Portal and has resolved 100% of these complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Ombudsman Portal and written callups</strong> Government has created an accessible platform for citizens of Pakistan to acquire expeditious and inexpensive relief for grievances filed against federal government agencies and to promote good governance along the way. BISP has been provided with an Ombudsmen online portal to cater to general complaints related to beneficiary complaints. There are two avenues utilized by beneficiaries or citizens to reach out to BISP via ombudsmen platform; one is through its online platform while other method is through written complaints to ombudsmen about BISP related issues. Written complaints have to be responded in writing and upon ombudsmen request attended in person by BISP officials for case response and management. BISP has dedicated resources including technical and legal for receiving and responding to complaints/grievances received through Ombudsmen and it ensures that cases are responded to in a timely and efficient manners without any escalations of grievances. From October 2022 to March 2023 BISP has received 16314 complaints out of which 21 complaints took some time to resolve and were escalated however currently all complaints stands resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Letter from beneficiaries (Urdu &amp; English)</strong> Among numerous channels that BISP has made available for beneficiaries to reach out at their convenience and in confidentiality, written letter constitute as one such channel. BISP has a dedicated staff for handling letters received from BISP beneficiaries, representatives from National and provincial assemblies and from various Government ministers like PASS ministry or directly from President house. These letters relate to selection of beneficiaries, their eligibility status, de-credit issues or any other matter a beneficiary or representative may deem necessary to highlight, to enquire about or to report. One the letters are received dedicated team members review those letters and acquire relevant information from different available sources. After information is gathered and vetted by responsible team members it is made part of the reply and sent (vis registered mail) to the beneficiary or representative on their address. It is pertinent to mention that during the assessment exercise team observed that letters received from beneficiaries were on a very specific format for making a complaint or enquiry. Furthermore, the format is not designed or authorized by BISP but local vendors have made a small business out of this exercise and skimming beneficiaries with a false hope that their cases will be accepted irrespective of the condition on ground. Such cases are only judged and handled on merit and those beneficiaries who have genuine concerns their concerns are resolved irrespective of the format in which the letter is written. Never the less it is a phenomenon that exists in certain areas of the country where beneficiaries are paying to acquire such services and should be discouraged or beneficiaries should be informed to discontinue such practices. However, the other side of the coin reveals that beneficiaries mostly illiterate don’t know how to write letters and even thought they can visit their local BISP field office to file complaints still fall pray to these people and have to pay to avail their services. On average BISP received 1262 Letter in Urdu and English and so far have replied to all queries.</p>
<p><strong>NON-BVS cases</strong> A major chuck of complaints received through different portals relate to NON-BVS, which essentially mean that beneficiary was unable to verify her fingerprints and thus unable to withdraw her funds. This is generally result of degradation of finger prints as a result of age or as a result of excessive work in rough circumstances forcing finger prints to fade and unrecognizable for the biometric verification machine. Such complaints once received are verified by BISP and by running them through internal controls. Once verified these complaints are sent to Banks for timely resolution. Once verified by Banks beneficiaries are usually issued letters and exempted from using BVS machines. As a major chunk of complaints relate to this category BISP has developed a system through which cases are sent to Banks every Monday after thorough review and investigation at BISP HQ. From November 2022 to March 2023 BISP has received 103,534 complaints related to Non-BVS, out of those 21,227 related to blocked cases while 82,307 cases were shared with Banks. It is pertinent to mention that 72,150 cases have been resolved and cash disbursement to beneficiaries have been completed while the 10,157 are still under process.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp Groups</strong> To make it more convenient and easier for citizens to reach concerned authorities at BISP or to acquire relevant information swiftly BISP has created dedicated WhatsApp groups. These groups mostly address payment related issues faced by beneficiaries and also provide general information as requested. It allows for instant communication between individuals and groups, which makes it easier for people to quickly report grievances or issues to relevant authorities or individuals. This platform is easy to use as most people are already familiar with WhatsApp and it prove to be an effective tool for facilitating grievance redressal as it offer rapid communication, group chat functionality, transparency, record keeping, and ease of use. These groups are generally used during cash disbarment of regular tranche and during special initiatives like flood response or ration provision to provide a platform to beneficiaries through which grievances are reported and solved in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Call center</strong> Call center is often the first point of contact for individuals filing complaints, and as such, it plays a critical role in ensuring that complainants receive timely and effective support. The call center’s primary function is to receive and manage complaints, ensuring that they are processed and addressed in a timely and efficient manner. The call center relies on a combination of software and hardware to carry out its functions effectively. At the heart of the call center’s operations is the complaint management system, which is used to record and track complaints throughout the process. This system enables call center operators to capture detailed information about the complaint, including the nature of the issue, the complainant’s contact information, and any relevant details related to the complaint. The complaint management system also enables operators to monitor the status of complaints and track their progress throughout the process. Hardware is also critical to the functioning of the call center. Call center operators used computers with specialized software to manage complaints efficiently. This software included features such as call routing, screen popping, and scripting tools to help operators manage complaints effectively. In addition, call centers often have a sophisticated telephony infrastructure, including automatic call distribution (ACD) systems, which help route calls to the appropriate agent quickly. It is pertinent to mention that currently the call center does not have Licensed software which provides a Dashboard for calls summary, ongoing calls, calls on wait now does the call center has access to all platforms necessary for review of beneficiary information, furthermore the hardware available was also issued more than 10 years ago and may require upgradation. More details on these issues are covered under Predictability.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sort-and-process"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Sort and process</h3>
<p>Upon receipt of grievance on PCMS, grievances are sorted and processed by the BISP GRM team. They review the grievance to determine its nature, scope, and relevance, and categorize it according to the it’s grievance management guidelines. This step involves verifying that the grievance is legitimate and within the scope of the BISP’s projects and activities. Grievances are dealt with according to three major categories that they fall in. Once grievance is received and categorized it is forwarded to the relevant office, in most cases the grievances are related to banks and thus are sent in batches to them for an early response. It is pertinent to mention that MOUs exists between Banks and BISP by which banks are bound to respond within a stated timeline, failure to do so results in financial penalties imposed on respective banks. Similarly, complaints received on Citizens Portal, Ombudsmen, WhatsApp groups and in written forms are sent straight to their respective dedicated teams housed at the HQ for early resolution and response. As these complaints form a minor chunk compared to the complaints received on PCMS it is considerably easy to sort and process by the dedicated teams.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acknowledge-and-follow-up"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.4</span> Acknowledge and follow-up</h3>
<p>Once the grievance has been processed in PCMS, BISP acknowledges receipt of the grievance to the affected party and provides information on the next steps in the process. BISP may also follow up with the affected party to request additional information or clarification. This step ensures that the affected party is aware that their grievance has been received and is being addressed. Generally upon receipt of a grievance through the PCMS system a ticket is generated and printed for beneficiary reference. This ticket holds all basic information related to beneficiary like her name, CNIC, District, Name of Complaint taker, Type of complaint, complaint status etc. Beneficiary is informed of tentative timelines for complaint resolution and what kind of response she can expect. At field level systems exists however at times the unavailability relevant resources (printer, cartridges) may limit the provision of services effectively. Similarly other platforms like Citizen’s portal, Ombudsmen portal have their own much strict timelines which has to be adhered to by BISP or they escalates and can adversely affect the overall performance of BISP grievance redressal mechanism.</p>

<section id="investigate-and-act" class="level3" data-number="7.1.5">
<h3 data-number="7.1.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="investigate-and-act"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.5</span> Investigate and act</h3>
<p>BISP conducts an investigation to determine the appropriate course of action based on the nature and severity of the grievance. The investigation may involve reviewing relevant documents, conducting interviews with stakeholders, and consulting with experts and with Banks. Based on the investigation, BISP makes a decision on how to address the grievance, which may include providing compensation, remedial measures, or other forms of redressal. This step involves a thorough and impartial investigation of the grievance and ensures that the BISP’s response is appropriate and effective. Some of the common complaints or grievances that BISP receives are Non-BVS, deductions, next of Kin; general enquires about status and tranche disbursement. The process for two is explained in detail to understand the modus operandi. Non-BVS are raised when a beneficiary go to a certain Point of sale (POS) to withdrawn the amount but is unable to do so due to finger mismatch. Reasons can be numerous for mismatch including age factor, finger degradation due to hard work or even excessive washing/cleaning activities etc. Once the complaint is lodged, processed and sent to the relevant wing; the concerned official reviews it with the collected data. This query is counter verified as sometimes POS agent system may not be very responsive and causing issues, in which case after a few days the beneficiary may return to same agent or to another one nearby and try her luck again. It was noticed that roughly 40-50 percent of such complaints are resolved either automatically when the beneficiary visits on another day to same or different POS agent and is successful in making a withdrawal. Or their cases falls in De-credit or ineligible category where their credentials are blocked after 16 attempts on two different BVS machines (8 attempts on each machine respectively). For ineligible cases various categories apply including beneficiary or spouse being a Government official, having a Car (1000 CC or above) etc. while De-credit cases include beneficiaries who for any reason have not been able to withdrawn their funds for over nine (9) months. For De-credit beneficiaries are sent to NADRA e-sahulat to re-verify their finger prints and provide a proof of life, following which their accounts are made active again. It is pertinent to mention that NADRA e-sahulat is not a free service however, BISP pays through its own funds so as not to put any sort of additional burden on the beneficiary. The officer responsible for resolving such queries keep a close eye on the status of payments and if beneficiary is successful in withdrawing her amount the complaint is withdrawn/resolved while in remaining cases where the problem of non-BVS persists the officer request the local office to double check the claim and reverify her finger prints and if it still cannot be resolved the concerned officer initiate a request with the concerned bank to update their system and issue an exemption letter for such beneficiaries so they can withdraw their funds without biometric verification. Once the process is complete and beneficiary is satisfied the compliant is closed and updated in PCMS. Second process that is worth mentioning relates to next of Kin where incase a beneficiary is deceased but as her family still lives under the poverty line her privileges are transferred to her eligible family member. Family members are requested to produce death certificate of the deceased along with Nadra CNIC cancellation certificate. Once relevant documents are presented they are added to the PCMS where the system is integrated with NADRA services to cross verify beneficiary family tree and next of kin information in real time and make a decision for final processing on spot.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monitoring-and-evaluation"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.6</span> Monitoring and evaluation</h3>
<p>Monitoring and Evaluation component is an integral part of any system put in place to ascertain the effectiveness of the process on an ongoing basis. PCMS has an inbuilt report generation system that allows user to download and review the reports. Reports are based on pre-defined formats and covers all relevant aspects of the grievance redressal mechanism. The reports include lodged complaints, region-wise, death reported summary, transgender appeal cases, BVS enrollment report, complaints against BVS/POS, list of complaints escalated etc. Evaluation of the PCMS system and its continuous improvement of the system has been evident from the fact that PCMS team has been continuously taking inputs from different level of users periodically and incorporating those changes in the system. Based on these feedbacks the system has been enhanced and new features have been added or refined as per the user needs and requirements. Currently the system is being operated in its 7th version (7.3) and have seen numerous improvements over time with room for more.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="provide-feedback"><span class="header-section-number">7.1.7</span> Provide feedback</h3>
<p>Once a decision has been made, BISP team or relevant banks provides feedback to the affected party on the outcome of the grievance. BISP may also provide feedback on how the grievance was handled and any changes that will be made to prevent similar grievances from arising in the future. This step ensures that the affected party is aware of the BISP’s decision and understands how the grievance was addressed. Feedback is provided through telephone calls, beneficiary in-person visits, written letters, government portals and WhatsApp groups.</p>
